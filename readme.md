# Streamlining Your AJAX Requests with AmplifyJS and jQuery â€“ Live Coding Source Code

This code was used in the Streamlining Your AJAX Requests with AmplifyJS and jQuery presentation delivered at
[RIA Unleashed](http://riaunleashed.com) in Waltham, MA.

Note: Most of this code was revealed during the live coding session. Only the result remains in this source code format, but you will need to comment out items to step through the code again. Here are a few notes about the concepts presented:

## How to play with this code:

(Check the page between each of the steps to see the changes)

1. Comment out the second portion of `mock-request-definitions.js` to see the initial mock syntax
2. Uncomment the second portion of `mock-request-definitions.js` to see mockJSON in use.
3. Comment out both mock files from `index.html` AND comment out the second request definition in `request-definitions.js` to see the real Dribbble API
4. Uncomment the second portion of `request-definitions.js` to see the decoder in action as we use the Forrst API
